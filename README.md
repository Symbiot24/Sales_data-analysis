# Data Analysis & Visualization Project

This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a large dataset using Python in Google Colab. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them through clear, informative visualizations.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used
- Google Colab
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## ðŸ“Š Project Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw data (handled missing values, duplicates, and formatting).
- Explored the dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends.
- Created visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, etc.) to communicate insights effectively.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings
- Importance of clean data in analysis
- Using Python libraries for efficient data manipulation and visualization
- Presenting data in a way that's easy to understand and impactful

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open the Colab notebook: [Link to your Colab notebook]
2. Run each cell sequentially to see the data analysis steps and visual outputs.

## ðŸ“Ž Sample Output
